# Configuring a DocuSign payments gateway

DocuSign offers built-in connections to multiple payment gateways. The payments example uses a demo account via the Stripe gateway service.

## Creating the payments gateway account

1. Open the **Settings** page.
1. Under **Integrations**, select [**Payments**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=payments), then select the Stripe button.
1. For development, you can skip the Stripe account application by using the **Skip this account form** link ![Skipping the Stripe account form](docs/stripe_skip_account_form_link.png)
1. Next, the Admin Tool will show that an enabled Stripe payment gateway account has been associated with your DocuSign Developer account.
1. Configure the example launcher with the gateway account id.
