# Configure a DocuSign payments gateway

DocuSign offers built-in connections to multiple payment gateways. The payments example uses a demo account via the Stripe gateway service.


## Create a Stripe payment gateway

1. Select the Stripe button on the [**Payments**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=payments) page.

1. For development, you can skip the Stripe account application by using the **Skip this account form** link at the top of the page. ![Skipping the Stripe account form](docs/stripe_skip_account_form_link.png) 

An enabled Stripe payment gateway is now associated with your DocuSign developer account and displays under  **Payment Gateway**.

1. Configure the code example launcher configuration file with the **Gateway Account ID**.
